# Background

## Why Vibe Text Editor?

Building rich text editors has always been one of the most challenging tasks in web development. Traditional approaches rely heavily on `contenteditable`, which brings a host of problems including inconsistent browser behavior, complex DOM mutations, and difficulty in maintaining precise control over cursor positioning and text selection.

## The Problem with Existing Solutions

### ContentEditable Issues
- **Browser Inconsistencies**: Different browsers handle `contenteditable` differently, leading to unpredictable behavior
- **DOM Mutations**: Uncontrolled DOM changes that are hard to track and manage
- **Selection Bugs**: Cursor positioning issues, especially around complex elements
- **Undo/Redo Complexity**: Browser's native undo stack conflicts with application state
- **Accessibility Problems**: Screen readers and other assistive technologies struggle with dynamic content

### Current Editor Limitations
- **ProseMirror**: Powerful but complex, steep learning curve, large bundle size
- **Draft.js**: Facebook's solution, but development has stagnated
- **Slate.js**: Modern architecture but still relies on contenteditable
- **TinyMCE/CKEditor**: Traditional WYSIWYG editors with legacy approaches

## Our Approach: ContentEditable-Free Architecture

Vibe Text Editor takes a revolutionary approach by completely avoiding `contenteditable` and implementing a custom cursor and selection system from the ground up.

### Core Principles

1. **Predictable Behavior**: Every cursor movement and selection operation is precisely controlled
2. **Framework Agnostic**: Built with React but designed to be portable to other frameworks
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
4. **Performance First**: Efficient rendering and minimal re-renders
5. **Accessibility**: Screen reader friendly with proper ARIA implementation
6. **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for custom functionality

### Technical Innovation

#### Custom Cursor System
- Uses `document.caretPositionFromPoint()` for precise positioning
- Implements logical cursor positions with `{node: Node, offset: number}`
- Supports "Goal-X" coordinate for consistent vertical navigation
- Handles atomic components (tables, images, etc.) as single units

#### Enhanced Selection Model
- Rich `Selection` class with anchor/focus management
- Direction-aware selection operations
- Visual selection rendering with multi-line support
- Programmatic selection manipulation

#### TreeWalker Navigation
- Custom DOM traversal that respects document structure
- Atomic component boundary detection
- Efficient text node enumeration
- Cross-browser compatibility
